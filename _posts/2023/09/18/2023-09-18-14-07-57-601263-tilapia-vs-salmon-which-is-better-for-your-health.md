If you're a seafood lover, you've probably come across both tilapia and salmon on restaurant menus or in the grocery store. While both fish offer a range of health benefits, they do differ in terms of nutritional value. In this blog post, we'll compare tilapia and salmon to help you decide which fish is better for your health.

## Nutritional Profile

- Source of vitamins and minerals: Tilapia contains vitamins B12 and D, as well as minerals like selenium and phosphorus.

### Salmon:

- High in protein: Just like tilapia, salmon is also an excellent source of high-quality protein.
- Vitamin D and B vitamins: Salmon is a good source of vitamin D, which plays a role in calcium absorption, and B vitamins, important for energy production.

## Health Benefits

While tilapia is lower in calories and fat, salmon's high omega-3 fatty acid content makes it a nutritional powerhouse.
