## Tips for Cooking Tilapia ##

- **Fresh is Best**: When purchasing tilapia, choose fillets that are firm, with no strong fishy odor. Look for bright, clear eyes and red gills.
- **Season It Right**: Tilapia has a mild flavor that pairs well with a variety of seasonings. Experiment with lemon zest, garlic, herbs like dill or thyme, or even Cajun or Mexican spice blends.
- **Don't Overcook**: Tilapia cooks quickly, so be careful not to overcook it. Overcooked tilapia can become dry and lose its delicate texture. Cook it just until it becomes opaque and flakes easily with a fork.
- **Grill or Pan-Fry**: While baking is a popular cooking method for tilapia, you can also grill or pan-fry it for added flavor and texture. Just make sure to use a high smoke point oil like canola or vegetable oil.
- **Pair with Fresh Sides**: Tilapia pairs well with a variety of fresh sides like roasted vegetables, steamed asparagus, or a crisp salad. Add a squeeze of lemon or a drizzle of olive oil for extra freshness.

Now that you have some delicious tilapia recipes and cooking tips under your belt, it's time to head into the kitchen and get cooking!
