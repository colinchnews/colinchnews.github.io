Seafood is a delicious and nutritious part of a balanced diet. However, it's important to be aware of potential risks, such as Vibrio vulnificus infections, that can be associated with the consumption of raw or undercooked seafood. Vibrio vulnificus is a bacteria commonly found in warm coastal waters and can cause serious illness if ingested.

Follow these tips to help prevent Vibrio vulnificus infections and enjoy seafood safely:

## 1. Always purchase fresh seafood

When buying seafood, make sure to choose fresh options from reputable sources. Look for fish that has bright eyes, vibrant skin, and a pleasant smell. Avoid seafood that appears discolored or has a strong, fishy odor, as these may indicate spoilage.

## 2. Properly store and handle seafood

Once you bring seafood home, it's crucial to store it properly to maintain freshness and prevent bacterial growth. Keep seafood refrigerated at temperatures below 40°F (4°C) and consume it within two days of purchase. If you don't plan to consume it within this timeframe, consider freezing it to prolong its shelf life.

## 3. Cook seafood thoroughly

Cooking seafood to the appropriate internal temperature is vital to kill any harmful bacteria, including Vibrio vulnificus. Follow recommended cooking guidelines for different types of seafood. For example, fish should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C), while shrimp and lobster should reach 145°F (63°C) as well.

## 4. Avoid consuming raw or undercooked seafood

To reduce the risk of Vibrio vulnificus infections, it's best to avoid consuming raw or undercooked seafood altogether. Some popular dishes like sushi, sashimi, ceviche, and oysters on the half shell fall into this category. Instead, opt for fully cooked seafood options or try dishes that undergo proper cooking processes, such as steaming, grilling, or baking.

## 5. Be cautious with high-risk individuals

Certain individuals are more susceptible to Vibrio vulnificus infections, especially those with weakened immune systems or chronic health conditions. If you or someone you know falls into this category, it's important to take extra precautions when consuming seafood. Consult with a healthcare professional to determine specific dietary guidelines and restrictions.

## 6. Educate yourself on seafood safety

Stay informed about seafood safety practices and any potential risks associated with certain types of seafood. Government health agencies and reputable seafood organizations regularly provide guidelines and updates. Familiarize yourself with these resources to make informed decisions when purchasing and consuming seafood.

By following these tips, you can minimize the risk of Vibrio vulnificus infections while still enjoying the benefits of seafood. Remember that proper storage, handling, and cooking techniques are key to ensuring the safety of seafood. Prioritize food safety and embrace a healthy relationship with seafood consumption.
