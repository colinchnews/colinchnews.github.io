No burger feast is complete without a side of crispy French fries. Whether you prefer the classic thin-cut fries or the thicker steak fries, the crunchy exterior and fluffy interior make them the perfect accompaniment to a juicy burger. For an extra indulgence, you can try loaded fries topped with cheese, bacon, and jalape√±os. 

## 2. Golden Onion Rings

Onion rings are a classic choice for burger lovers. Their crispy coating and sweet onion flavor complement the savory taste of a burger perfectly. If you want to add a twist, consider trying different variations, such as beer-battered onion rings or spicy sriracha-infused ones. Don't forget to pair them with some zesty dipping sauces like chipotle mayo or tangy ketchup.

## 3. Tangy Coleslaw

Coleslaw is a refreshing side dish that adds a cool and tangy element to a burger meal. The crisp cabbage, carrots, and creamy dressing provide a contrast to the rich flavors of the burger. You can choose between vinegar-based or mayo-based coleslaw, depending on your preference. The slight tanginess and crunch of coleslaw make it a versatile side dish that complements any type of burger.

## 4. Grilled Corn on the Cob

For a summer twist on your Burger Day celebration, pair your burgers with some grilled corn on the cob. The sweetness of the corn combined with the smoky flavors from the grill adds a delightful contrast to the savory burger. Brush the corn with butter and sprinkle it with your favorite seasonings such as salt, pepper, or chili powder for extra flavor.

## 5. Fresh Garden Salad

If you're looking to balance out the richness of a burger, a fresh garden salad is the way to go. A mix of crisp lettuce, juicy tomatoes, cucumbers, and other colorful veggies tossed in a light vinaigrette provides a refreshing and healthy side dish option. The vibrant flavors and textures of the salad will lighten up your meal and add a burst of freshness.

## 6. Sweet Potato Fries

For a twist on traditional fries, try pairing your burger with sweet potato fries. These fries offer a slightly sweet and savory flavor profile and have a crispy exterior with a soft interior. They are also packed with nutrients and fiber, making them a healthier alternative to regular fries. Dip them in a spicy aioli or a tangy ranch dressing for an extra kick.

## 7. Cheesy Mac and Cheese

With options like truffle mac and cheese or bacon mac and cheese, you can take this side dish to the next level of deliciousness.
